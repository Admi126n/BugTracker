# Bug / Idea tracker

This is simple program which helps track all bugs and ideas which occurs while
coding. Instead of making notes I can write down everything here and sort by
type, priority or status.

#### Available functions:
- Adding bugs/ideas
- Showing all items or filter by type/status/priority
- Editing status/priority
- Changing workspace
- Deleting workspace
- Editing title/description

#### Planed updates:
- Option to generate .tex file with all issues/ideas
- Graphical user interface

#### Version
1.2.0

Changelog:
- 1.2.0 - Added option to edit idea/issue title/description
- 1.1.0 - Added option to delete workspace
- 1.0.0 - Working program (without editing title/description and deleting workspaces)
