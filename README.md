# Bug / Idea tracker

This is simple program which helps track all bugs and ideas which occurs while
coding. Instead of making notes I can write down everything here and sort by
type, priority or status.

#### Available functions:
- Adding bugs/ideas
- Showing all items or filter by type/status/priority
- Editing status/priority
- Changing workspace
- Deleting workspace
- Editing title/description
- Option to generate .txt file with tex code with all bugs/ideas listing

#### Planed updates:
- Graphical user interface
- MacOS version (in Swift)

#### Manual
After compiling code create directory (e.g. BugTracker) in which you want to store BugTracker files.
After that put .exe file inside. You can use it to run program or you can create shortcut and run program with it.
Generated .tex file has been tested in https://www.overleaf.com

#### Version
1.3.1

- 1.3.1 - Added removing characters which are forbidden as directory name from workspace name
- 1.3.0 - Added option to generate .txt file with tex code
- 1.2.0 - Added option to edit idea/bug title/description
- 1.1.0 - Added option to delete workspace
