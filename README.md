# Bug / Idea tracker

This is simple program which helps track all bugs and ideas which occurs while
coding. Instead of making notes I can write down everything here and sort by
type, priority or status.

#### Available functions:
- Adding bugs/ideas
- Showing all items or filter by type/status/priority
- Editing status/priority
- Changing workspace
- Deleting workspace
- Editing title/description

#### Planed updates:
- Option to generate .tex file with all bugs/ideas
- Graphical user interface

#### Manual
After compiling code create directory (e.g. BugTracker) in which you want to store BugTracker files.
After that put .exe file inside. You can use it to run program or you can create shortcut and run program with it.

#### Version
1.2.0

Changelog:
- 1.2.0 - Added option to edit idea/bug title/description
- 1.1.0 - Added option to delete workspace
- 1.0.0 - Working program (without editing title/description and deleting workspaces)
